            <p>It's not true
                Tell me I’ve been lied to
                Crying isn't like you, ooh
                What the hell did I do?
                Never been the type to
                Let someone see right through, ooh
                
                Maybe won't you take it back?
                Say you were tryna make me laugh
                And nothing has to change today
                You didn’t mean to say: I love you
                I love you
                And I don't want to, ooh
                
                Up all night
                On another red-eye
                We wish we never learned to fly
                Maybe we should just try
                To tell ourselves a good lie
                Didn't mean to make you cry, I
                
                Maybe won't you take it back?
                Say you were tryna make me laugh

                You didn't mean to say: I love you
                I love you
                And I don't want to, ooh
                
                The smile that you gave me
                Even when you felt like dying
                
                We fall apart as it gets dark
                I'm in your arms in Central Park
                There's nothing you could do or say
                I can’t escape the way I love you
                I don’t want to
                But I love you, ooh
                Ooh, ooh
