            <p>Thought I found a way
                Thought I found a way out (found)
                But you never go away (never go away)
                So I guess I gotta stay now
                
                Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
                Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
                Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
                Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
                
                Isn't it lovely, all alone?
                Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
                Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
                Hello, welcome home
                
                Walkin' out of town
                Lookin' for a better place (lookin' for a better place)
                Something's on my mind (mind)
                Always in my headspace
                
                But I know someday I'll make it out of here
                Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
                Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
                Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
                
                Isn't it lovely, all alone?
                Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
                Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
                Hello, welcome home

            <p>It's not true
                Tell me I’ve been lied to
                Crying isn't like you, ooh
                What the hell did I do?
                Never been the type to
                Let someone see right through, ooh
                
                Maybe won't you take it back?
                Say you were tryna make me laugh
                And nothing has to change today
                You didn’t mean to say: I love you
                I love you
                And I don't want to, ooh
                
                Up all night
                On another red-eye
                We wish we never learned to fly
                Maybe we should just try
                To tell ourselves a good lie
                Didn't mean to make you cry, I
                
                Maybe won't you take it back?
                Say you were tryna make me laugh
                And nothing has to change today
                You didn't mean to say: I love you
                I love you
                And I don't want to, ooh
                
                The smile that you gave me
                Even when you felt like dying
                
                We fall apart as it gets dark
                I'm in your arms in Central Park
                There's nothing you could do or say
                I can’t escape the way I love you
                I don’t want to
                But I love you, ooh
                Ooh, ooh
                Ooh, ooh</p>

            <p>
                Don't you know I'm no good for you?
                I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
                Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
                But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
                
                Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
                I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
                I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
                
                Don't you know too much already?
                I'll only hurt you if you let me
                Call me friend, but keep me closer (call me back)
                And I'll call you when the party's over
                
                Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
                And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
                Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
                
                But nothin' is better sometimes
                Once we've both said our goodbyes
                Let's just let it go
                Let me let you go
                
                Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
                I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
                I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that</p>
